# Chatbot Interaction System

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a chatbot, featuring persistent memory, a custom quit function, and selectable bot personalities.

## Features

-   **Persistent Bot Memory**: Enhances conversation continuity by remembering previous interactions.
-   **Custom Quit Function**: Offers flexible entries to quit program and prevents accidental chat termination by requiring explicit user confirmation.
-   **Selectable Bot Personalities**: Allows users to choose the bot's personality for a customized chat experience.

## Instructions

1.  Clone this project to your local machine: https://github.com/graysonmeckfessel/chai_coding_challenge
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires only the `requests` library as an external dependency. Install it using `pip install requests`.
4.  To start a chat session, run one of the following commands from the project directory:
    -   `python classic_chatbot.py` for interacting with "Bot" (your friendly AI companion).
    -   `python choose_your_own_chatbot.py` to converse with a character of your choice (e.g., Oprah Winfrey, Nostradamus, the Moon).
5.  Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the chatbot.
